# Peer Review 10
#### A simple project for explorating CoreLocation and MapKit in iOS.
##### This project is 10/15 Peer Review projects done in the course \"iOS Development for Creative Entrepreneurs\" by UCI.

---
In this project, we have 3 locations of interest in the bottom UIToolBar, and a Toggle to show user's location.
The three location of interests are denoted by MapKit's MKPointAnnotation, which takes in coordinates for the location and a title to show relevent location.
The show users location toggle is used to toggle the *locationManager*'s *startUpdatingLocation* and *MapKitView*'s *showsUserLocation*. 
The application looks as follows.
